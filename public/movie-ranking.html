<h1>The Best Movies According To Mary</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>

<h3>The Scorpion King</h3>
<p>Dwayne Johnson stars as The Scorpion King named Mathayus. He was an Akkadian warrior who was widely known as the Scorpion King, and he would later become an ancient evil that Rick O'Connell stopped from destroying the world. Egyptian movies and music has always been a favorite of mine, and what also makes this movie great is that it stars The Rock.</p>
<h3>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</h3>
<p>If you have seen funny Johnny Depp videos on YouTube, then you have probably came across the famous "I got a jar of dirt" scene.  That is from Dead Man's Chest. The chest of Davy Jones is a chest that contains the beating heart of Davy Jones. Jones locked it in the chest and buried it on Isla Cruces, hiding it from the man.
This is one of my favorite Depp movies because of his humor, wit, and the adventure of course! </p>
<h3>Just Go With It</h3>
<p>His heart recently broken, plastic surgeon Danny Maccabee pretends to be married so he can enjoy future dates with no strings attached. His web of lies works, but when he meets Palmer, the gal of his dreams, she resists involvement. Instead of coming clean, Danny enlists Katherine, his assistant, to pose as his soon-to-be-ex-wife. Instead of solving Danny's problems, the lies creates more trouble. This is a romantic comedy with two amazing actors, Adam Sandler starring as the plastic surgeon and Jennifer Aniston being his assistant.</p>
